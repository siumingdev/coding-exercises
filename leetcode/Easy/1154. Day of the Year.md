https://leetcode.com/problems/day-of-the-year/

## Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def dayOfYear(self, date: str) -> int:
        def divisible(a, b):
            return (a % b) == 0
        
        year, month, day = (int(_) for _ in date.split("-"))
        is_leap_year = divisible(year, 4) and ((not divisible(year, 100)) or divisible(year, 400))
        
        days_of_month = [
            31, 
            29 if is_leap_year else 28,
            31,
            30,
            31,
            30,
            31,
            31,
            30,
            31,
            30,
            31
        ]
        
        day_of_year = 0
        for i, _day in enumerate(days_of_month):
            if i + 1 < month:
                day_of_year += _day
            else:
                day_of_year += day
                break
                
        return day_of_year
```

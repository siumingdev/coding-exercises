# 191. Number of 1 Bits

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/

## Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        hamming = 0
        while n > 0:
            hamming += 1
            n = n & (n - 1)
        return hamming
```

## Analysis:

Let $k$ be the number of 1 bits in the bit string.

### Time Complexity:

$O(k)$: the bit manipulation trick n & (n - 1) filps the rightmost 1 to 0, so the total number of iteration is the number of 1 $k$.

e.g. of the trick:
n = 110100
n - 1 = 110011
n & (n - 1) = 110000

### Space Complexity:

$O(1)$

# 669. Trim a Binary Search Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/trim-a-binary-search-tree/

## Solution:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def trimBST(self, root: TreeNode, low: int, high: int) -> TreeNode:
        def dfs(node, parent, root):
            if node is None:
                return root
            
            replace_by = None
            if node.val < low:
                replace_by = node.right
            elif node.val > high:
                replace_by = node.left
            else:
                root = dfs(node.left, node, root)
                root = dfs(node.right, node, root)
                return root
            
            if parent is None:
                root = replace_by
                return dfs(root, None, root)
            else:
                if parent.left is node:
                    parent.left = replace_by
                else:
                    parent.right = replace_by
                return dfs(replace_by, parent, root)
            
        return dfs(root, None, root)
```

The above is my original solution. It is over complicated since at first I didn't observed that if the node value is out of bound, the whole subtree with `node` as root is replaced by it's left or right subtree. With this observation, the solution can be simplified as:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def trimBST(self, root, low, high):
        def trim(node):
            if not node:
                return None
            elif node.val > high:
                return trim(node.left)
            elif node.val < low:
                return trim(node.right)
            else:
                node.left = trim(node.left)
                node.right = trim(node.right)
                return node

        return trim(root)
```

## Analysis:

Let $N$ be the number of nodes.

### Time Complexity:

$O(N)$

### Space Complexity:

$O(\log N)$: recursion call stack memory usage for a balanced tree.

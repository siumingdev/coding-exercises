# 501. Find Mode in Binary Search Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-mode-in-binary-search-tree/

## Solution:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def findMode(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:
        counts = dict()
        
        def traverse(node):
            if node is None:
                return
            counts[node.val] = counts.get(node.val, 0) + 1
            traverse(node.left)
            traverse(node.right)
        
        traverse(root)
        
        max_count = -1
        modes = []
        for val, count in counts.items():
            if count > max_count:
                max_count = count
                modes = [val]
            elif count == max_count:
                modes.append(val)
        
        return modes
```

## Analysis:

Let $N$ be the number of nodes.

### Time Complexity:

$O(N)$

### Space Complexity:

$O(N)$

### Points to Note:

Follow up (not yet done): Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).

Consider in-order traversal?

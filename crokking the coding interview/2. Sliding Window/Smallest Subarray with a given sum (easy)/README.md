# Smallest Subarray with a given sum

## Problem Statement

Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number ‘S’, find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to ‘S’. Return 0, if no such subarray exists.

## Naive Solution

Try all subarray. Number of subarray = $O(N^2)$, so time complexity is also $O(N^2)$.

## Better Solution

Implemented in `solution.py`. Time complexity = $O(N)$. Space complexity = $O(1)$.

Idea: supplement later
